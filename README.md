As with any other model, printing should be simple. No extra settings are required, but there are few tips to keep in mind:

If you’re going to print your lithophane vertically, it’s best to set the layer height as low as possible.
Since we want all the details, it’s better if you don’t print at high speed. Try to keep it lower than 2000 mm/min.
Setting the infill to 100% will let the light do its trick better.
Don’t use transparent filaments.
Once it’s all set up, go ahead and print. Ideally, a standard-sized lithophane could take up to 6 hours to print with the above settings.
